2048 Game Rules
In this game, the player must combine tiles containing the same numbers until they reach the number 2048. The tiles can contain only integer values starting from 2, and that are a power of two, like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on.

Ideally, the player should reach the 2048 tile within the smallest number of steps. The board has dimension of 4 x 4 tiles, so that it can fit up to 16 tiles. If the board is full, and there is no possible move to make like merging tiles together - the game is over.
